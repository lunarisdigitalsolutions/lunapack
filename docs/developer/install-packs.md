# Discover and install packs

After adding a source, list available packs and preview the change before
writing files.

Discovery recommends an install command when packs are available. After a
successful install, Luna recommends checking for updates, updating installed
packs, or uninstalling the pack. A dry run shows only its plan.

```powershell
luna discover
luna install dotnet-project --dry-run
luna install dotnet-project
```

Use `id@version` to choose an exact release:

```powershell
luna install dotnet-project@1.0.0 --dry-run
```

The dry run resolves the pack and preflights the target changes without
modifying project files or LunaPack state. Remove `--dry-run` when the plan is
ready to apply.

For installation customization, see [Parameters and variables](parameters-and-variables.md),
[Lifecycle hooks](lifecycle-hooks.md), and [Remap managed targets](remap-targets.md).
